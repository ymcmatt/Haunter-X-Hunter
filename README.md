# Haunter-X-Hunter
A multi-player hide and seek game using PhotonNetworking

Role: Programmer, Producer
Team Size: 4 (2 programmers, 1 artist, 1 sound designer)
Project Duration: 4 weeks

This game is designed to be presented at ETC Festival @CMU, where there will be over 500 guests. So we decide to build a game that can involve as many guests as possible. 

This game is a multiplayer hide and seek game, where hider's job is to possess furniture in a house and seeker's job is to find where hider has possessed. However, our game has a very important feature: audience participation. 

Audiences will be looking at a very special "spectator view", where they can monitor both the hider and seeker's view. They will then decide together a hint word to give to seeker to help him figure out where the hider is. The host then can input the hint to the game, where both hider and seeker can read. 

Our game is decided to involve 2 players (hider and seeker) and at most 20 audiences for every round. On the day of Festival, our game hosted over 200 guests. 

What I did:
 - Developed the networking feature using Photon
 - Developed the game logic for hiding, seeking and interacting with objects
 - Developed 3 scenes (hider scene, seeker scene and spectator scene) and connected them using Photon​​​​​​​
 - As the producer, lead the team and setup working pipeline for programmers, artist and sound designer to work with.
